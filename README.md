# Ricky

Ricky is a simple command line tool that will open a random Wikipedia article
starting with the letter you provide:

```
ricky u
```

The command above for example might open the Wikipedia page for [Uinta National
Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uinta_National_Forest), [Una
Stubbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Una_Stubbs), or any other number of
interesting articles.

## Installation

If you're using macOS and have homebrew installed, you can install Ricky with:

```
brew install dnsbty/dnsbty/ricky
```

Otherwise, download the archive appropriate for your operating system and CPU
architecture from [the latest
release](https://github.com/dnsbty/ricky/releases/latest). Unzip the archive
with `tar -xvf ricky_X.X.X_{OS}_{ARCHITECTURE}.tar.gz` and then move the `ricky`
file to somewhere in your path to make it easier to use.
